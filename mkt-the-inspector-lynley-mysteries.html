                            <p>The Inspector Lynley Mysteries. Drama series about upper-crust DI Thomas Lynley and working class DS Barbara Havers, based on the novels of Elizabeth George. On iPlayer. Not available. With Nathaniel Parker, Sharon Small, Lesley Vickerage, Paul Hickey. British crime investigation series based around aristocratic, Oxford-educated Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his working-class assistant Sergeant Barbara Havers. The Inspector Lynley Mysteries is a British crime drama, broadcast on BBC One from 12 March 2001 to 1 June 2008, comprising six series and twenty-three episodes. The protagonist, Detective Inspector Thomas "Tommy" Lynley, 8th Earl of Asherton (Nathaniel Parker), who is assigned to Scotland Yard, finds himself paired with Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers (Sharon Small). I'd like to get my mom started on another mystery series for the coming year. She just finished (and loved) the Inspector Gamache series by Louise Penny, and also thoroughly enjoyed the Inspector Lynley series by Elizabeth George. Any series with a similar protagonist that you think she might enjoy? Historical fiction is a bonus. 
Episode Recap The Inspector Lynley Mysteries on TV.com. Watch The Inspector Lynley Mysteries episodes, get episode information, recaps I find myself very drawn to murder mystery series recently. I'm in the process of reading Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley/Havers books and gobbled up the Girl with the Dragon tattoo series a few years ago. I'm looking for books closer to Elizabeth George in style (slightly less suspenseful, not as long, not as violent). Preferable if based outside the United States. I prefer a series since you can form an attachment to the characters and their various eccentricities. Any and all suggestion. When the body of Lynley's godson is discovered more than a decade after his disappearance, Lynley is drawn into the case, leading him first to Rome and then deep into the middle of a new murder enquiry - in which Lynley himself becomes the prime suspect. And, Lynley and Havers friendship is pushed to its limits in a psychologically-chilling investigation into the abduction of two teenage girls.

Some of my favorite mystery series have been those where each book can stand on its own, but if you read the whole series you will see character development, and maybe an overarching storyline. I'm thinking of those like: The Peter Wimsey amp Harriet Vine mysteries by Dorothy Sayers (Gaudy Night was great) Brother Cadfael series by Ellis Peters Ruth Rendell's Inspector Wexford Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley The Mistress of the Art of Death series by Ariana Franklin. Some others. 
After a farmer is found decapitated, aristocratic Detective Inspector Lynley is assigned to the case with a resentful new partner, D.S. Barbara Havers. Inspector Lynley and his stalwart sidekick Detective Sergeant Havers return for a fifth season of solving intense and complex mysteries. The original awkward partnership of the aristocratic Lynley and the working class Havers has been transformed by time and shared experience into a nuanced relationship as fascianting as the crimes. The Inspector Lynley Mysteries (TV Series 2001–2008) cast and crew credits, including actors, actresses, directors, writers The heart of this series is still the relationship between Lynley and Havers, who have complemented each other in increasingly nuanced ways over the years.
